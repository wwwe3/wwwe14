<meta name="description" content="The UK has fared better as America continues to dominate Times Higher Education’s (THE) official World University Rankings for the second year in a row. Oxford has moved up from third to second place this year as Imperial College London also sees a one-point rise from ninth to eight place on 2014/15. The rankings also herald a change as Switzerland’s ETH Zürich is the only non-UK and non-US institution to feature this academic year, as Yale and California, Berkeley fall out of the top ten and into 12th and 13th place respectively." />
